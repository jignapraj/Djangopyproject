# Challenges Faced:
Throughout development, I faced various challenges, notably in establishing a connection to the database, which led to reinstalling all packages. Additionally, I encountered routing issues and CSS styling challenges. The debugging process was lengthy, particularly regarding the routing and database code development. I implemented Bootstrap to design the application pages to improve the user interface, focusing on achieving a clean and user-friendly layout. I am struggling with implementing a delete feature in the application, as I have yet to determine the root cause of the code's malfunction. If I had more time, I would have fixed this problem and tried to add animations and transitions for a better view of the UI.
